# gui_plot application
### My Python Certificate project.  

This Graphical Interface loads data from multiple types of sources to plot the locations
and altitudes of flights across the US.  It used the OpenSky python API freely available at
https://github.com/openskynetwork/opensky-api

It utilizes listbox, file menus, checkboxes, buttons, canvas and plot frames.

###Special Python Packages used:
1.  opensky-api - query data from the opensky
2.  matplotlib - plotting and animation
3.  tkinter - GUI and widgets
4.  pandas - for storing data queried and filtered data into a Dataframe
5.  basemap - load world map onto plot frame
6.  numpy - arrays
7.  abc - abstract method class
8.  logging - handler for debugging
9.  unittest - limited to 



###Python Programming techniques used:
1.  OOP Classes with Abstract class and inheritance.  
2.  Decorators (@StaticMethod, @AbstractMethod)
3.  Python packaging
4.  Logging
5.  List comprehension
6.  Unit testing
7.  dicts and lists and tuples
8.  pickle
